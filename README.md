Express Library performance comparator

### Usage

In this example we compare the performance of express 4.1.2 and 4.18.2 using the official express bechmarking tool.

```bash
node index.js 4.1.2 4.18.2

You can use VSCode to compare the files, just open the folder in VSCode and select the files you want to compare and right-click on the compare button.

The generated files are: `previous.txt` and `current.txt`
